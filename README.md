# RulFramework

This framework provides the possibility to make rul prediction in two different ways:

-with transfer learning: splitting the dataset based on a feature passed as parameter. <br/>
-without transfer learning: shuffling the dataset after shuffling.

The framework gives the possibility to use these services directly with framework.py.<br/>
Alternatively, you can use more specific utils with model.py and dataset.py<br/>
See the examples directory for some tutorial
